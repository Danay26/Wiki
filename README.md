Advantages of Unit Testing

Software unit testing can aid in finding problems prematurely. By writing the unit test code before the main code itself can be a huge advantage and time saver. It is essential to test code before it is shipped off to testers and clients. It would be of better interest to test each section of code as it is made to ensure code is perfect each section, rather than running into hundreds of errors at the final run of the program. Another huge benefit of unit testing is that the programmer can change code later on and the room to facilitate change has improved drastically. The process of regression testing is to create test cases for all methods and snippets of code so that whenever the programmer changes a snippet of code and the program records a fault , it can be spotted quickly.
